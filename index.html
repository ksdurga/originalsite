      <p>Hello!  I recently decided to persue programming after getting out of the military.  I did water chemistry and radiological controls 
         for the reactor plants on aircraft carriers during my time in the Navy.  While that was interesting at the time, I'm ready to try 
         something new.  Aside from coding and knowing a lot about reactor plant operations, I also rock climb, do yoga, play ultimate frisbee, 
         and do stand up comedy.  As you can imagine, I am definitely never bored.</p>

      <p>I grew up in Boston and much to the dismay of a lot of people (losers), I'm a Patriots fan.  I have enjoyed living in Washington, D.C. 
         quite a bit, but I'm excited to get back to the west coast.  I love being outside and exploring mountains.  I'd like to move to either the 
         PNW or to Colorado upon completion of this class.</p>
